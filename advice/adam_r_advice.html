			<h4>It's okay to feel lost and confused!</h4>
			
			<p>I was once told not to use the word “hard”. Hard should be reserved for people battling cancer, losing a loved one, or giving birth.  Coding isn’t hard, but it is challenging, especially if you’ve never done it before.</p>  

			<p>But every day it will get just a little bit easier with practice.  Just like learning to ride a bike, the first few times you crashed, then you felt wobbly for a while and then you hit the sidewalk and eventually the street.  Consider this to be your path to coding…it is a process – a very confusing process, but a process.  </p>

			<p>However, unlike riding a bicycle – in this journey you aren’t alone.  Sure you will still fall, a lot, but you have  a lot of resources to fall back on.  This class, Skillcrush, but then there are also a ton of resources for you that will help your mind slowly untangle the coding knot that is forming inside of you.  </p>

			<p>Just keep practicing and never stop peddling and eventually you will be riding on your own.  Again – coding isn’t hard but is confusing, but you can do it.  </p>
