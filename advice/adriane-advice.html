			<h4>It's Never Too Late!</h4>
			<p>It's never too late to learn something new. A lot people change jobs and aquire new skills after they've left their 20's behind them, and when you really think about it, people adjust to changes all the time even within the confines of a particular job or routine. Looking at history, think about how much has changed as we went from the 50's to the 60's, the 90's to 2010, and keep in mind that the average life span is about 78 years. Learning is, then, an inevitabilty for everyone at every age bracket. You aren't too old to learn a new skill!</p>
			<h4>It's Like Eating A Giant Sanmmich!</h4>
			<p>If you try to shove a large sandwich in your face, it falls apart, makes a mess, you end up looking silly and possibly embarassing yourself in front of others. However, if you cut the sandwich into smaller bites, adding a toothpick or two where needed, then it becomes much more managable and enjoyable. Learning to code is like being presented with a really big overwhelming sandwich. Breaking it into bites you can handle is the best way to go so you avoid being overwhelmed.</p>
			<h4>It Will Take Time From Other Things</h4>
			<p>You'll have to sacrifice some things time wise at some point. Choose wisely and remember to put yourself first.</p>
