			<h4>Keep learning!</h4>
			<p>Coding is a skill that takes time, energy, and most of all, practice. Therefore, while you're learning, it's best to continue to practice on a daily basis. The concepts are difficult, but the best way to commit them to memory is through consistent practice every day.</p>

			<p>Don't get too worried if you're struggling, or feel frustrated. We've all been there. Yes, even us professionals. Remember that your Skillcrush buddies are always here to help, and best of all -- there's Google. Don't be afraid to ask questions from your coding friends or Google.</p>

			<h4>Never give up!</h4>
			<p>This is a new language after all. Frustration, impatience and disbelief are your friends on this coding journey.</p>

			<p>Don't be afraid to try. You may fail, but that's why we're working in branches and not on the master code. Have fun, play around and most of all, don't ever give up!</p>
