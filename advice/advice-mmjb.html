			<h4>Stop Thinking and Start Doing!</h4>
			<p>Programming is exactly like learning a new language. It will take time for this new organization of letters and commands to make sense in your brain. That's ok! Stop thinking and just do it.</p>

			<p>You are going to be making new neural pathways in your brain. You are supposed to feel disoriented and confused. Keep going.</p>

			<h4>Trust the Process</h4>
			<p>Start with HTML. Figure out how that works. Add CSS. Then figure out how that works. If you get stuck - google it. Literally, type your question into google. You will discover that you are not alone in your confusion. Use any and all online resources that you can click on! This is the embodiment of collaborative learning.</p>

			<p>Small warning...chances are there will be more than one way to solve your problem. Find the one that makes sense to your brain. Keep moving. Don't try and analyze why the other way works too. Does it work? Does it look right? Keep moving.</p>

			<p>No matter where a programmer is on the learning continuium of coding - there will ALWAYS be more to learn. This is NOT a static language and it is guaranteed to keep changing, so keep moving!</p>
