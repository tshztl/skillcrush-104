			<h3>Confusion is your friend!</h3>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>You are going to doubt your abilities and feel so overhwelmed. But I am here to tell you to keep pushing through it. Especially when you are stuck on the smallest thing for most of the day. Once, you figure it out, there is a great feeling of satisfaction...until it happens again on something else.</p>

			<p>Stay focused and positive you will succeed if only you believe in yourself. If you need answers, Google is my best friend. There is someone that has gone through what you are going through so if you google it you will find an answer. Yes, you may have to dig a bit.<p>
