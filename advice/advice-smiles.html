			<p><span>Confusion is your friend!</span><br><br>
			When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before.<br>
            <br><span>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction.</span> You are on your way to enlightenment - just keep pushing ahead!</p>
        </div>        
        <div class="advice-2">
			<p><span>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</span><br><br>
			You know something is wrong with what you've created. But that's okay!<br>
			<br>You'll learn as you work to figure out the problem, and that skill of finding the answer when you don't even know that actual question will come in handy <span>MANY</span> times in the future.</p>
		</div>
        <div class="advice-3">
			<p><span>Have fun!</span><br><br>
            Remember that you are changing your life. <span>For the better!</span> You are learning a lot of new tech skills, and it can feel hard, but think of everything you're capable of doing now!<br>
			<br>Create a website for yourself devoted to your favorite things, be it puppies or rock n' roll. Just play and enjoy this education.</p>
