			<h4>Practice Helps</h4>
			<p>The first time you come to a challenge, it can be extremely overwhelming. That's why practicing helps so much--the more times you do something, the more second-nature it becomes and the more confident you will feel!</p>


			<h4>Don't Stress</h4>
			<p>It will seem like it's all too much when you tackle something new, but just remember that everyone started out as a beginner like you. With patience and practice, you're sure to get it!</p>
