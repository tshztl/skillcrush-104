			<h4>Be Patient</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge and a new opportunity.</p>

			<p>Be patient with yourself, this is exactly like learning a new language. YOu can't know everything all at once, it takes time to build up your learning... start with the baby steps. This may seem slow, but you will get better with practice.</p>

			<p>Just like learning a new langauge, you have to learn the basics, understand how the language is structured, and then start adding in your basic words.</p>
