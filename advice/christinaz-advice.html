			<h3>If you have decided you want to pursue something, <span>do it.</span></h3>

			<h2>Once you know what you want, <span>commit!</span></h2>

			<h3>You could spend all week, all year, or the rest of your life being wishy-washy if you never make that choice.</h3>

			<h3>Some people are never blessed with a passion, something they really enjoy.</h3>

			<h2>Once you find your passion, <span>follow your dream!</span></h2>

			<h3>Don't be afraid of hard work. And don't be afraid of failure.</h3>

			<h3>If you are afraid, then don't let the fear make your decisions for you.</h3>

			<h2>It doesn't help you to be on the right track if you never move forward!</h2>

			<h2><span>Take the leap!</span></h2>
