			<h2>Shop around but stick with one language at the beginning</h2>
			<p>It is crazy out there! When starting to program things are going to become overwhelming fast. Languages, libraries, frameworks, apps, etc... Which one is which, and which should your care about?</p>
			<p>This is where time and a course or codecamp comes in. THey help your make sense and focus on what it is out there.</p>
			<p>Especially when it comes to JavaScript! There is so much emphasis behind this language that it is overwhelming to understand what is what.</p>
			<p>Do yourself a favor and don't start learning coding with JavaScript. Choose a friendlier and better teaching language like Ruby or Python.</p>
