			<h4>Take it one step at a time</h4>
			<p>When you begin anything new and are excited about it you tend to want to rush ahead. The problem with this is that you often skip important steps that you need to follow in order to get things right.</p>

			<p>This is not always a bad thing as you will learn along the way but when you are starting out it is can be a big deal. Take it easy and get your bearings straight before taking any major leaps.</p>

			<h4>Don't get upset if it doesn't work the first time</h4>
			<p>I believe that this is very much a trial and error area of expertise. You will sometimes get things right the first time, but don't sweat it if you missed something. Just go back and keep trying until you can work it out. This is part of the fun.</p>

			<p>You get to become a code sleuth, hunting down the cuplrit of your frustration.</p>

			<p>What ever you do, just don't give up. This is a great experience and wonderful knowledge to have. It will hopefull take you to great new levels in your life.</p>
