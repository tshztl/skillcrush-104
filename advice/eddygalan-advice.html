			<h4>Test in al browsers!</h4>
			<p>When you are writing you html code make sure you open all browsers and check that the look and feel is the same in all of them. The first time I created my first web site I was entirely focused on one browser thinking that it would look the same for the others.</p>

			<p>When I send the link to a friend to see my awesome work he came back to me saying....What the hell? He asked if it was a joke, that everything was all over the place. I thought he was joking because it looked great in the browser I was using. Then he told me he was using a different one. When I opened the page in that browser...I passed out.</p>

			<h4>Looping around</h4>
			<p>When using loops make sure that it is going to exit at some point. CHeck the boolean condition, or the the index that increases or decreseas to make sure that at some point reaches the condition. Otherwise you might find your self having to force quitting the program you are using to code since it goes complete unresponsive</p>
