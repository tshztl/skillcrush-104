			<h4>Google it!</h4>
			<p>When you are first starting, you may be taught one way and you may get it.  Or you may not get it.  Just google it.  There are tons of resources, tutorials, and videos.  There is always another way to learn it.</p>

			<h4>It's a buggie world!</h4>
			<p>Yes, we are not perfect and we will from time to time need help.  You might be stuck on resolving an error and you have be on it for two days.  Just ask!!!  There a lot of people out there who love to help.  They are wicked awesome! Worst case, just google it. Someone has probably fixed that same issue. </p>
			
			<h4>Have fun!</h4>
			<p>What's really cool is that we "coders" or "programmers" are in our own world of languages.  We can drop little inside jokes or real jokes in code and developers would be the only ones to see it.  Wink, wink.  HAVE FUN! </p>
