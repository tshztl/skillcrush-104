			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
		<div class="confusion-bff">
			<p>According to Skillcrush, "Confusion is your friend." If this is true, confusion and I are BFFs! So here's my advice - don't let confusion stop you. Keep forging ahead, Google what you don't understand, practice and practice some more, look for programs that fit your needs and inspire you on your learning journey, share with others and don't be afraid to ask those "stupid" questions.</p>
		</div>	
		
		<div class="knowledge-is-power">
			<p>And slowly (or at least for me it was slow) confusion will start to morph into those "aha" moments where little bits and pieces of knowledge come together, making you feel like you have the power to rule the world!!...Okay, that escalated quickly...maybe not rule the world but the power that is knowledge can rock your world! </p>

			<p>Going back to Skillcrush advice...</p>
			
			<p class="skillcrush-quote"><span>"</span>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.<span>"</span></p>

			<h4>Remember, my friend...</h4>
		<div class="none-perfect">
			<p>We are all human, none of us is perfect. We all learn at different speeds and in different ways. Some days of learning are awesome and you are on the top of the world, while other days...well, you feel pretty good knowing how to turn the computer on.</p>
		</div>
			
		<p>When you have one of those days...<span class="cursive">Remember</span>:</p>
			
		<div class="list-one">
			<ul>
				<li>You're learning a new language,and mastering that language probably won't happen in one day or even one week...so <span class="cursive">give yourself a break.</span></li><br>
				<li><span class="cursive">Breathe</span>...you will figure out the padding and margins on the stupid box model!</li><br>
				<li>Get up, get away and take a <span class="cursive">walk</span>...before you throw that computer out the window</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<div class="list-two">
			<ul>
				<li> You're not alone in this learning journey, so <span class="cursive">seek</span> out others for advice... or an empathetic ear to whine into.</li><br>
				<li>Some days are going to be like this...remember <span class="cursive">tomorrow is a new day.</span></li><br>
				<li><span class="cursive">Be thankful</span> for the opportunity to learn... many people aren't given that opportunity to broaden their horizons.</li>
			</ul>
