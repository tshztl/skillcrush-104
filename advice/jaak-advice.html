			<h4>Confusion is the wind for your sails!</h4>
			<p>When you start learning programming here in Skillcrush, at first maybe it feels a bit confusing and overwhelming, that you don't get all the right answers for the questions you have to solve and everyday you get more new problems to play with. But at some time you start to notice, that with every day you get something new, what in the beginning is confusing but at the same time you notice that you have learned and solved something new, what was confusing at first few days ago.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>No matter what, how confusing and how much it time to time looks like this thing here is not meant for You, You keep going forward!</p>

			<p>So lets move on, things can only get better from here on!</p>
