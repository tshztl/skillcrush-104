		<h2>I have some advice for you!</h2>

			<h4>Don't be afraid to fail</h4>
			<p>Because you will fail. A lot. You can't expect perfection the first
				time out of the gate. Not gonna happen. Just remember that the failure
				is only temporary. It's a learning opportunity. Every time your code fails
				to work, you get to learn how to fix it. Once you know how to fix it,
			 	you probably won't make the same mistake again.</p>

			<h4>Take a walk</h4>
			<p>This goes right along with not being afraid to fail.</p>

			<p>Things go wrong. You might find yourself literally banging your head
				on your desk out of frustration simply because you can't figure out where
				the problem is. Then you'll start questioning your decision to learn to
				code. You'll feel like an imposter.</p>

			<p>Go take a walk.</p>

			<p>No. Seriously. Go take a walk.</p>

			<p>Sometimes walking away for a few minutes and doing something else is the
				best thing you can do. It allows you to think about other things for a while.
				Inevitably, your mind will go back to the problem waiting for you on your
				computer screen. That's when you can start thinking the problem through rationally.
				Consider your past projects. Think about how you accomplished similar tasks before.
				The answers are there. You just have to allow yourself to find them.</p>

			<h4>Remember, you are not alone</h4>
  		<p>Developers are a helpful bunch. And you are taking this course with a whole
				bunch of them. Make use of the google group. Scan through the other topics, and find out
				if anyone else has had a similar problem. If so, maybe the answers they received will
				help you. If not, just ask!</p>
