			<h4>Embrace Your Own Style of Learning</h4>
			<p>Don't be afraid to stray from the path a little as you learn. You will pick up some concepts more quickly that others, and struggle in areas that they don't. Accept that. Don't be afraid to jump ahead or review old lessons.</p>
			<p>Change the subject if you're stuck. Work on something else for a while. The only reason I'm writing this today is because I got frustrated with a lesson and decided to skip ahead to the next class for a bit. So far I've done almost a week's worth of lessons in 24 hours. I'm pretty sure that was the right choice.</p>
			<p>But don't discount the way you are being taught just because it is not your way of learning. Sometimes you have to struggle through. The trick is figuring out what blend of their teaching style and your learning style will be the most effective. Experiment.</p>
			<h4>There Will Always Be Someone Better Than You at Something</h4>
			<p>It's easy to get discouraged when you see amazing work done by others and think, "I could never do that!" That is the wrong mindset. You can't do that now, but nothing is stopping you from learning how to do it later.</p>
			<p>Coding is collaborative and ever changing. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. And every project has its own balance of needs. So get competent at what you need and excellent at what you love.</p>
			<p>Yes, there will pretty much always be someone better than you in every specific subset of coding expertise. But no one will have the unique mix of tech skills, soft skills, passion, and personality that you will bring to your clients or your company. So learn from others and be the best you that you can be!</p>
