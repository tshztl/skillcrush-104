			<h4>Practice is your Friend!</h4>
			<p>When you first make the decision to learn to code, make up your mind that you WILL be able to do it!  I've always beliveved that we can do anything that we put our minds to.</p>

			<p>From the very first day, commit yourself to daily practice.  Look at the classes and the challenge of learning as a practice. The same as an Olympic athlete, or a professional athlete, or a world famous musician. </p>

			<h4>When injury interfers with Practice.</h4>
			<p>Sometimes your frustration will feel like an injury. Sometimes you will not be able to take the next step because the one you are currently on is still too painful. </p>

			<p>So, do what any athlete would do, take a few days off from your practice to heal. Clear your mind. Let your frustration marinate until it becomes edible. Until it transforms into determination.</p>

			<p>After you heal, start over. Study every letter; study every symbol. Do not let a bunch of letters, and numbers and symbols steal your dream. </p>
