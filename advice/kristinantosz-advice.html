			<h4>No one was born an expert.</h4>
			<p>It's easy to feel embarrassed when you're first starting out. Every question seems dumb, whether you're asking in an online forum or to a friend who is more seasoned. Wanting to be knowledgable, wanting to be the best is natural, but it takes hard work, practice, and a little bit of fumbling around.</p>
			<p>Everyone started out like you once, asking questions, feeling confused. They didn't just master 8,000 programming languages overnight. Everyone starts out as a beginner, and that's not a bad thing.</p>

			<h4>Read the directions thoroughly.</h4>
			<p>I can't tell you how many Skillcrush challenges I thought weren't working right because I missed one little step (or misspelled a tiny word in a line of code)</p>
