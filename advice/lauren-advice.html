			<h3>This too shall pass</h3>

			<p>For all the excitement, trying to transition to a whole new career is draining. We get up each day, sit down at the machine, and have to solve all kinds of problems just to get to the point where we can start the actual to-do list.</p>

			<p>It's good to acknowledge that getting behind isn't because you're lazy. Even if it's not the <em>life</em> stuff none of us can avoid, the very tech stuff we're supposed to love soooooo goddamn much if we ever want to get hired is going to get in the way.</p>

			<p>You can't start your lessons when you installed an OS incompatible with your hardware. Or you erase your entire hard drive trying to format a flash drive. And finally, you think you've successfully installed Java, but somehow only the compiler is installed (how is that even possible!!! isn't JDK a superset of JRE?).</p>

			<p>We smile, head to the co-working space, down a few coffees. It will be ok. But every day? It's lonely and frustrating and seriously (sorry, skillcrush) <em>not fun</em>.</p>

			<h4>It's time for a break</h4>
			<p>You might not be learning the things you intended to learn, but they're important nonetheless. Look how far you've come! However broken and helpless and worthless and alone and despairing you feel right now---it will pass. You can and you will get through.</p>

			<p>Even if that means not getting out of bed some days.</p>
