			<h4>Be Kind to Yourself!</h4>
			<p>You're a beginner and there is nothing wrong with that! Even Steve Jobs was a beginner once and look what he did. So, be kind to your self. If you don't get a concept just keep exploring it until you do!</p>

			<h4>Google. Google, Google!</h4>
			<p>I can't stress this enough. When in doubt, google it! Don't go out and buy and expensive book that is just going to collect dust on your desk. Crack those knuckles and get your google on.</p>

			<h4>Never Stop Learning!</h4>
			<p>In the world of code, there will always be something new to learn. So don't limit yourself. Keep seeking new and inovative ways to solve problems. </p>

			<h4>Enjoy the Journey!</h4>
			<p>You'll never be a beginner again so enjoy the adventure!/p>
