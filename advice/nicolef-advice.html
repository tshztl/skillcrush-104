			<h4>HTML & CSS are your friend!</h4>
			<p>Don't be afraid to seek information all over the web! Skillcrush is a good starting point but there are so many good places to find information on the web </p>
			<p>Your code will break, and you'll hit bumps all the time. Keep pushing through it, ask for help!</p>

			<h4>You're going to be confused All. The. Time!</h4>
			<p>It's totally normal that you'll be writing code and seeing it on your screen, but not knowing how or why it's there.
			<p>Duh, you're learning a whole new language! It take's time and patience to figure things out.</p>

			<p>Finally, learning to code is not a 10 week process, it's a lifetime process. Keep up with the new technology, read read read everything you can, and have fun!</p>
