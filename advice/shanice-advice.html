			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>Learning a new language can be exciting, scary, and challenging. Coding is no different. It's fun when you start to learn about the different tags and see everything come together. On the other hand, it can be very frustrating when you are trying to do one thing, and another happens. The main thing to remember is to keep at it! Don't give up!</p>

			<p>Confusion is natural. We all have moments when we wonder what is happening and why we decided to embark on this journey. Try something new and hit refresh! Eventually, you'll get there and one of the best feelings in the world is to hit refresh and see on the page what you envisioned in your mind!</p>

			<h4>Impostor Syndrome is Natural</h4>
			<p>Think you stick out like a sore thumb? It's possible! The truth is, we all experience impostor syndrome at one point or another. The fix? Keep at it anyway! Maybe you don't "belong" in the tech world...yet! Practice may not make perfect but it will certainly help you become better! Find time to make coding a part of your daily schedule!</p>

			<p>The most important thing you should know? You CAN do it! Don't give up, even when you think you should. It is possible for you to learn something new and you will be happy you did!</p>
