			<h3>Distractions</h3>
			<p>There is always a learning curve when you are trying something new.  Here is some advice to minimize this learning curve.</p>
			<div>
				<ul>
					<li>Work on your coding when you are mentally at your best</li>
					<li>Dedicate at least an hour each day</li>
					<li>Take a 5 minute break every 20 minutes</li>
					<li>Ask for help sooner than later</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="advice">
			<h3>Keep Going</h3>
			<p>It is inevitable that you will get stuck.  You’ll exhaust yourself researching a solution.  You’ll reach out to others for help and still be unclear. I found that if I just keep going in the lesson my understanding becomes clearer and eventually a light bulb turns on to the issue that I was facing.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="advice">
			<h3>Never Give Up</h3>
			<p>And finally, if you are like me transitioning from another career field, you may say to yourself after many days of frustration, “I might be better off just staying where I am”.  Don’t give in to this negative commentary.  Just remember if it is your passion it is worth it to never give up.</p>
