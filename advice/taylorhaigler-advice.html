			<h4>Review Review Review!</h4>
			<p>Once you start to feel things click make sure you continue to review the material and give yourself time to practice so you may solidify the learning that you have done. This will help to make you feel confident in what you have stuided and urge you to keep powering through new topics.</p>
			
			<h4> Put yourself out there!</h4>
			<p>Step out of your comfort zone and join a meet up group. Volunteering is a great way to put yourself out there. You work individually the majority of the time, step out and meet people face to face to help humanize the work you are doing.</p>
